# Reverse T-Rex Run (Pterodactyl Fly)

> The idea of this game is based on T-Rex Run on Google Chrome, but the difference is that it is kind of a reverse version of T-Rex Run, you're not the T-Rex any more, now you're a Pterodactyl trying to fly as far as possible and avoiding T-Rex, Tacus and Rockets.
